theres not much economic oppurtunities over there.
```

Yes, I love my hometown, if it were up to me I wouldnt have left.
Fresh air, abundant trees, and a lot of naturals springs.
```

## 5. Is there anything that you dislike about it?

I personally would find it difficult to survive without reliable internet
and a stable supply of electricity.

I rarely do, almost always only during rare or grave occasions. 
Basically, only on weddings and funerals,
I find it incredibly hard to squeeze in time at my stage in life.

```
It used to be the location of the country's one and only steel milling facility,
but that was a long time ago before globalization weeded out incompetent players in the industry.
Now theres barely any trace of that factory anymore.
